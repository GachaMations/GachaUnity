# Gacha Unity
Gacha Unity is a project started around the start of 2022, in an attempt to recreate the main games (currently Gacha Life, Gacha Club and Gacha Life 2) in the Unity game engine, rather than Adobe Flash. This allows easier access to the game's code, for adding new features, and modding.

More information about the games are available on thair respective pages. If being viewed on GitHub, these should be available on my profile, along with links to it in the GachaUnity repo's code.

Currently 2 of the 3 games are private, as they are extremely WIP, and don't really work. Gacha Life Unity is still public, as it's the first game, and most likely the project i'll finish first.
